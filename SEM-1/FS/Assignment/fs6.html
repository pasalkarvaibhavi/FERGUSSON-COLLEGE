    <p>The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are the leading international sporting
        events featuring summer and winter sports competitions <br>in which thousands of
        athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions.
        The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports<br> competition with more than
        200 teams, representing sovereign states and territories, participating.
        By default, the Games generally substitute for any world championships during the
        year in which they take place.
        
        </p>
         
         <p>The Olympic Games are held every four years. Since 1994, they have 
         alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during <br>the 
         four-year Olympiad. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, held in Olympia,
          Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. The Olympic Charter defines their structure and authority.</p>
